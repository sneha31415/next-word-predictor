of single flaming beryl boots which extended halfway up',\n 'his calves and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur',\n 'completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested

minutes afterwards the sittingroom',\n 'window will open you are to station yourself close to that open',\n 'window',\n 'yes',\n 'you are to watch me for will be visible to you',\n 'yes',\n 'and when raise my handsoyou will throw into the room what',\n 'give you to throw and will at the same time raise the cry of fire',\n 'you quite follow me',\n 'entirely',\n 'it is nothing very formidable he said taking long cigarshaped',\n 'roll from his pocket it is an ordinary plumbers smokerocket',\n 'fitted with cap at either end to make it selflighting your task',\n 'is confined to that when you raise your cry of fire it will be',\n 'taken up by quite number of people you may then walk to the end of',\n 'the street and will rejoin you in ten minutes hope that have',\n 'made myself clear',\n

seemed to vary with every fresh part that he',\n 'assumed the stage lost fine actor even as science lost an acute',\n 'reasoner when he became specialist in crime',\n 'it was quarter past six when we left baker street and it still',\n 'wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in serpentine',\n 'avenue it was already dusk and the lamps were just being lighted as',\n 'we paced up and down in front of briony lodge waiting for the coming',\n 'of its occupant the house was just such as had pictured it from',\n 'sherlock holmes succinct description but the locality appeared to',\n 'be less private than expected on the contrary for small street',\n 'in quiet neighbourhood it was remarkably animated there was',\n 'group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in corner',\n 'scissorsgrinder with his wheel two guardsmen who were flirting with',\n 'nursegirl and several welldressed young men who were lounging up',\n 'and down with cigars in their mouths',\n 'you see remarked holmes as we paced to and fro in front of the',\n 'house this marriage rather simplifies matters the photograph',\n 'becomes doubleedged weapon now the chances are that she would be',\n 'as averse to its being seen by mr godfrey norton as our client is',\n 'to its coming to the eyes of his princess now the question iswhere',\n 'are we to find the photograph',\n 'where indeed',\n 'it is most unlikely that she carries it about with her it is',\n 'cabinet size too large for easy concealment about womans dress',\n 'she knows that the king is capable of having her waylaid and',\n 'searched two attempts of the sort have already been made we may',\n 'take it then that she does not carry it about with her',\n 'where then',\n 'her banker or her lawyer there is that double possibility but am',\n 'inclined to think neither women are naturally secretive and they',\n 'like to do their own secreting why should she hand it over to anyone',\n 'else she could trust her own guardianship but she could not tell',\n 'what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon',\n 'business man besides remember that she had resolved to use it',\n 'within few days it must be where she can lay her hands upon it it',\n 'must be in her own house',\n 'but it has twice been burgled',\n 'pshaw they did not know how to look',\n 'but how will you look',\n 'will not look',\n 'what then',\n 'will get her to show me',\n 'but she will refuse',\n 'she will not be able to but hear the rumble of wheels it is her',\n 'carriage now carry out my orders to the letter',\n 'as he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of carriage came round the',\n 'curve of the avenue it was smart little landau which rattled up to',\n 'the door of briony lodge as it pulled up one of the loafing men at',\n 'the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning',\n 'copper but was elbowed away by another loafer who had rushed up',\n 'with the same intention fierce quarrel broke out which was',\n 'increased by the two guardsmen who took sides with one of the',\n 'loungers and by the scissorsgrinder who was equally hot upon the',\n 'other side blow was struck and in an instant the lady who had',\n 'stepped from her carriage was the centre of little knot of flushed',\n 'and struggling men who struck savagely at each other with their',\n 'fists and sticks holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady',\n 'but just as he reached her he gave cry and dropped to the ground',\n 'with the blood running freely down his face at his fall the',\n 'guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in',\n 'the other while number of betterdressed people who had watched',\n 'the scuffle without taking part in it crowded in to help the lady',\n 'and to attend to the injured man irene adler as will still call',\n 'her had hurried up the steps but she stood at the top with her',\n 'superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall looking back',\n 'into the street',\n 'is the poor gentleman much hurt she asked',\n 'he is dead cried several voices',\n 'no no theres life in him shouted another but hell be gone',\n 'before you can get him to

street may we bring him in marm',\n 'surely bring him into the sittingroom there is comfortable',\n 'sofa this way please',\n 'slowly and solemnly he was borne into briony lodge and laid out in',\n 'the principal room while still observed the proceedings from my',\n 'post by the window the lamps had been lit but the blinds had not',\n 'been drawn so that could see holmes as he lay upon the couch do',\n 'not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for',\n 'the part he was playing but know that never felt more heartily',\n 'ashamed of myself in my life than when saw the beautiful creature',\n 'against whom was conspiring or the grace and kindliness with which',\n 'she waited upon the injured man and yet it would be the blackest',\n 'treachery to holmes to draw back now from the part which he had',\n 'intrusted to me hardened my heart and took the smokerocket from',\n 'under my ulster after all thought we are not injuring her we',\n 'are but preventing her from injuring another',\n 'holmes had sat up upon the couch and saw him motion like man who',\n 'is in need of air maid rushed across and threw open the window at',\n 'the same instant saw him raise his hand and at the signal tossed',\n 'my rocket into the room with cry of fire the word was no sooner',\n 'out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators well dressed and',\n 'illgentlemen ostlers and servantmaidsjoined in general',\n 'shriek of fire thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and',\n 'out at the open window caught glimpse of rushing figures and',\n 'moment later the voice of holmes from within assuring them that it',\n 'was false alarm slipping through the shouting crowd made my way',\n 'to the corner of the street and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find',\n 'my friends arm in mine and to get away from the scene of uproar he',\n 'walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had',\n 'turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the edgeware',\n 'road',\n 'you did it very nicely doctor he remarked nothing could have',\n 'been better it is all right',\n 'you have the photograph',\n 'know where it is',\n 'and how did you find out',\n 'she showed me as told you she would',\n 'am still in the dark',\n 'do not wish to make mystery said he laughing the matter was',\n 'perfectly simple you of course saw that everyone in the street was',\n 'an accomplice they were all engaged for the evening',\n 'guessed as much',\n 'then when the row broke out had little moist red paint in the',\n 'palm of my hand rushed forward fell down clapped my hand to my',\n 'face and became piteous spectacle it is an old trick',\n 'that also could fathom',\n 'then they carried me in she was bound to have me in what else',\n 'could she do and into her sittingroom which was the very room',\n 'which suspected it lay between that and her bedroom and was',\n 'determined to see which they laid me on couch motioned for air',\n 'they were compelled to open the window and you had your chance',\n 'how did that help you',\n 'it was allimportant when woman thinks that her house is on fire',\n 'her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most',\n 'it is perfectly overpowering impulse and have more than once',\n 'taken advantage of it in the case of the darlington substitution',\n 'scandal it was of use to me and also in the arnsworth castle',\n 'business married woman grabs at her baby an unmarried one reaches',\n 'for her jewelbox now it was clear to me that our lady of today had',\n 'nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest',\n 'of she would rush to secure it the alarm of fire was admirably',\n 'done the smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel',\n 'she responded beautifully the photograph is in recess behind',\n 'sliding panel just above the right bellpull she was there in an',\n 'instant and caught glimpse of it as she halfdrew it out when',\n 'cried out that it was false alarm she replaced it glanced at the',\n 'rocket rushed from the room and have not seen her since rose',\n 'and making my excuses escaped from the house hesitated whether',\n 'to attempt to secure the photograph at once but the coachman had',\n 'come in and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait',\n 'little overprecipitance may ruin all',\n 'and now asked',\n 'our quest is practically finished shall call with the king',\n 'tomorrow and with you if you care to come with us we will be',\n 'shown into the sittingroom to wait for the lady but it is probable',\n 'that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph it',\n 'might be satisfaction to his majesty to regain it with his own',\n 'hands',\n 'and when will you call',\n 'at eight in the morning she will not be up so that we shall have',\n 'clear field besides we must be prompt for this marriage may mean',\n 'complete change in her life and habits must wire to the king',\n 'without delay',\n 'we had reached baker street and had stopped at the door he was',\n 'searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said',\n 'goodnight mister sherlock holmes',\n 'there were several people on the pavement at the time but the',\n 'greeting appeared to come from slim youth in an ulster who had',\n 'hurried by',\n 'ive heard that voice before said holmes staring down

the king of bohemia rushed into',\n 'the room',\n 'you have really got it he cried grasping sherlock holmes by',\n 'either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face',\n 'not yet',\n 'but you have hopes',\n 'have hopes',\n 'then come am all impatience to be gone',\n 'we must have cab',\n 'no my brougham is waiting',\n 'then that will simplify matters we descended and started off once',\n 'more for briony lodge',\n 'irene adler is married remarked holmes',\n 'married when',\n 'yesterday',\n 'but to whom',\n 'to an english lawyer named norton',\n 'but she could not love him',\n 'am in hopes that she does',\n 'and why in hopes',\n 'because it would spare your majesty all fear of future annoyance if',\n 'the lady loves her husband she does not love your majesty if she',\n 'does not love your majesty there is no reason why she should',\n 'interfere with your majestys plan',\n 'it is true and yetwell wish she had been of my own station',\n 'what queen she would have made he relapsed into moody silence',\n 'which was not broken until we drew up in serpentine avenue',\n 'the door of briony lodge was open and an elderly woman stood upon',\n 'the steps she watched us with sardonic eye as we stepped from the',\n 'brougham',\n 'mr sherlock holmes believe said she',\n 'am mr holmes answered my companion looking at her with',\n 'questioning and rather startled gaze',\n 'indeed my mistress told me that you were likely to call she left',\n 'this morning with her husband by the 515 train from charing cross',\n 'for the continent',\n 'what sherlock holmes staggered back white with chagrin and',\n 'surprise do you mean that she has left england',\n 'never to return',\n 'and the papers asked the king hoarsely all is lost',\n 'we shall see he pushed past the servant and rushed into the',\n 'drawingroom followed by the king and myself the furniture was',\n 'scattered about in every direction with dismantled shelves and open',\n 'drawers as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her',\n 'flight holmes rushed at the bellpull tore back small sliding',\n 'shutter and plunging in his hand pulled out photograph and',\n 'letter the photograph was of irene adler herself in evening dress',\n 'the letter was superscribed to sherlock holmes esq to be left till',\n 'called for my friend tore it open and we all three read it',\n 'together it was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in',\n 'this way',\n 'my dear mr sherlock holmes',\n 'you really did it very well you took me in completely until after',\n 'the alarm of fire had not suspicion but then when found how',\n 'had betrayed myself began to think had been warned against',\n 'you months ago had been told that if the king employed an agent it',\n 'would certainly be you and your address had been given me yet with',\n 'all this you made me reveal what you wanted to know even after',\n 'became suspicious found it hard to think evil of such dear kind',\n 'old clergyman but you know have been trained as an actress',\n 'myself male costume is nothing new to me often take advantage of',\n 'the freedom which it gives sent john the coachman to watch you',\n 'ran up stairs got into my walkingclothes as call them and came',\n 'down just as you departed',\n 'well followed you to your door and so made sure that was',\n 'really an object of interest to the celebrated mr sherlock holmes',\n 'then rather imprudently wished you goodnight and started for',\n 'the temple to see my husband',\n 'we both thought the best resource was flight when pursued by so',\n 'formidable an antagonist so you will find the nest empty when you',\n 'call tomorrow as to the photograph your client may rest in peace',\n 'love and am loved by better man than he the king may do what he',\n 'will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged keep',\n 'it only to safeguard myself and to preserve weapon which will',\n 'always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future',\n 'leave photograph which he might care to possess and remain dear',\n 'mr sherlock holmes',\n 'very truly yours',\n 'irene norton née adler',\n 'what womanoh what woman cried the king of bohemia when we',\n 'had all three read this epistle did not tell you how quick and',\n 'resolute she was would she not have made an admirable queen is it',\n 'not pity that she was not on my level',\n 'from what have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on very',\n 'different level to your majesty said holmes coldly am sorry',\n 'that have not been able to bring your majestys business to more',\n 'successful conclusion',\n 'on the contrary my dear sir cried the king nothing could be',\n 'more successful know that her word is inviolate the photograph is',\n 'now as safe as if it were in the fire',\n 'am glad to hear your majesty say so',\n 'am immensely indebted to you pray tell me in what way can',\n 'reward you this ring he slipped an emerald snake ring from his',\n 'finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand',\n 'your majesty has something which should value even more highly',\n 'said holmes',\n 'you have but to name it',\n 'this photograph',\n 'the king stared at him in amazement',\n 'irenes photograph he cried certainly if you wish it',\n 'thank your majesty then there is no more to be done in the',\n 'matter have the honour to wish you very goodmorning he bowed',\n 'and turning away without observing the hand which the king had',\n 'stretched out to him he set off in my company for his chambers',\n 'and that was how great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of',\n 'bohemia and how the best plans of mr sherlock holmes were beaten by',\n 'womans wit he used to make merry over the cleverness of women',\n 'but have not heard him do it of late and when he speaks of irene',\n 'adler or when he refers to her photograph it is always under the',\n 'honourable title of the woman',\n 'the redheaded league',\n 'had called upon my friend mr sherlock holmes one day in the',\n 'autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with very',\n 'stout floridfaced elderly gentleman with fiery red hair with an',\n 'apology for my intrusion was about to withdraw when holmes pulled',\n 'me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me',\n 'you could not possibly have come at better time my dear watson',\n 'he said cordially',\n 'was afraid that you were engaged',\n 'so am very much so',\n 'then can wait in the next room',\n 'not at all this gentleman mr wilson has been my partner and',\n 'helper in many of my most successful cases and have no doubt that',\n 'he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also',\n 'the stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave bob of',\n 'greeting with quick little questioning glance from his small',\n 'fatencircled eyes',\n 'try the settee said holmes relapsing into his armchair and',\n 'putting his fingertips together as was his custom when in judicial',\n 'moods know my dear watson that you share my love of all that is',\n 'bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday',\n 'life you have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has',\n 'prompted you to chronicle and if you will excuse my saying so',\n 'somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures',\n 'your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me',\n 'observed',\n 'you will remember that remarked the other day just before we went',\n 'into the very simple problem presented by miss mary sutherland that',\n 'for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life',\n 'itself which is always far more daring than any effort of the',\n 'imagination',\n 'proposition which took the liberty of doubting',\n 'you did doctor but none the less you must come round to my view',\n 'for otherwise shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your',\n 'reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right now',\n 'mr jabez wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this',\n 'morning and to begin narrative which promises to be one of the',\n 'most singular which have listened to for some time you have heard',\n 'me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often',\n 'connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes and',\n 'occasionally indeed where there is room for doubt whether any',\n 'positive crime has been committed as far as have heard it is',\n 'impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of',\n 'crime or not but the course of events is certainly among the most',\n 'singular that have ever listened to perhaps mr wilson you would',\n 'have the great kindness to recommence your narrative ask you not',\n 'merely because my friend dr watson has not heard the opening part',\n 'but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to',\n 'have every possible detail from your lips as rule when have',\n 'heard some slight indication of the course of events am able to',\n 'guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to',\n 'my memory in the present instance am forced to admit that the',\n 'facts are to the best of my belief unique',\n 'the portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some',\n 'little pride and pulled dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the',\n 'inside pocket of his greatcoat as he glanced down the advertisement',\n 'column with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon',\n 'his knee took good look at the man and endeavoured after the',\n 'fashion of my companion to read the indications which might be',\n 'presented by his dress or appearance',\n 'did not gain very much however by my inspection our visitor bore',\n 'every mark of being an average commonplace british tradesman obese',\n 'pompous and slow he wore rather baggy grey shepherds check',\n 'trousers not overclean black frockcoat unbuttoned in the front',\n 'and drab waistcoat with heavy brassy albert chain and square',\n 'pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament frayed tophat',\n 'and faded brown overcoat with wrinkled velvet collar lay upon',\n 'chair beside him altogether look as would there was nothing',\n 'remarkable about the man save his blazing red head and the',\n 'expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features',\n 'sherlock holmes quick eye took in my occupation and he shook his',\n 'head with smile as he noticed my questioning glances beyond the',\n 'obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour that he',\n 'takes snuff that he is freemason that he has been in china and',\n 'that he has done considerable amount of writing lately can',\n 'deduce nothing else',\n 'mr jabez wilson started up in his chair with his forefinger upon',\n 'the paper but his eyes upon my companion',\n 'how in the name of goodfortune did you know all that mr',\n 'holmes he asked how did you know for example that did manual',\n 'labour its as true as gospel for began as ships carpenter',\n 'your hands my dear sir your right hand is quite size larger than',\n 'your left you have worked with it and the muscles are more',\n 'developed',\n 'well the snuff then and the freemasonry',\n 'wont insult your intelligence by telling you how read that',\n 'especially as rather against the strict rules of your order you use',\n 'an arcandcompass breastpin',\n 'ah of course forgot that but the writing',\n 'what else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five',\n 'inches and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where',\n 'you rest it upon the desk',\n 'well but china',\n 'the fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist',\n 'could only have been done in china have made small study of',\n 'tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the',\n 'subject that trick of staining the fishes scales of delicate pink',\n 'is quite peculiar to china when in addition see chinese coin',\n 'hanging from your watchchain the matter becomes even more simple',\n 'mr jabez wilson laughed heavily well never said he',\n 'thought at first that you had done something clever but see that',\n 'there was nothing in it after all',\n 'begin to think watson said holmes that make mistake in',\n 'explaining omne ignotum pro magnifico you know and my poor',\n 'little reputation such as it is will suffer shipwreck if am so',\n 'candid can you not find the advertisement mr wilson',\n 'yes have got it now he answered with his thick red finger',\n 'planted halfway down the column here it is this is what began it',\n 'all you just read it for yourself sir',\n 'took the paper from him and read as follows',\n 'to the redheaded league on account of the bequest of the late',\n 'ezekiah

earth does this mean ejaculated after had twice read',\n 'over the extraordinary announcement',\n 'holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair as was his habit when in',\n 'high spirits it is little off the beaten track isnt it said',\n 'he and now mr wilson off you go at scratch and tell us all about',\n 'yourself your household and the effect which this advertisement had',\n 'upon your fortunes you will first make note doctor of the paper',\n 'and the date',\n 'it is the morning chronicle of april 27 1890 just two months ago',\n 'very good now mr wilson',\n 'well it is just as have been telling
